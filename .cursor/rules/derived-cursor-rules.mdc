## Headers

This document defines the rules and guidelines for the AI coding assistant to follow while working on this project. It covers project structure, coding standards, workflow, and best practices. This file is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## Project Description

The AI coding assistant is working on a multilingual code generation library named "Coder". This library aims to provide a flexible and extensible way to represent code in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) format, serialize and deserialize the AST to YAML, and generate code in various programming languages from the AST. The application project should be a TUI (Text User Interface) using Spectre.Console. One use case is to construct expressions, functions, objects via a node based visual editor, using this library as the authoring and storage provider for that frontend.

## TECH STACK

- .NET 7 or later
- YamlDotNet (for YAML serialization and deserialization)
- .NET 9 (identified during build process)
- Spectre.Console (for TUI)
- Spectre.Console.Cli (for command-line interface features)
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

- Implementation Plan: `docs/implementation-plan.md`
- Design Document: `docs/design.md`

## CODING STANDARDS

- Follow .NET coding conventions.
- Use meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes.
- Write clear and concise code with comments where necessary.
- Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate exception handling.
- Write unit tests for all components.
- Use dependency injection to promote loose coupling.
- All files must include a copyright notice.
- Implement the `Clone()` method properly in AST node classes, ensuring derived classes `override` it. When cloning `Metadata`, clear the existing dictionary and copy the values from the original instead of assigning a new dictionary.
- Address code analysis warnings and errors identified during build processes (e.g., CS8852, IDE2003, CA1502, IDE0010, CA2227, CA1822, CS8604, CA1031, CA1062, IDE0060, CS1591, IDE0055).
    - Ensure that all method parameters are validated for null values, throwing `ArgumentNullException` when necessary.
    - Suppress CA1031 warnings only when catching generic exceptions at the top level of a `Main` method, using a pragma directive.
    - Ensure that all method parameters are validated for null values, throwing `ArgumentNullException` when necessary.
- Ensure that deserialization logic handles the correct casing for node type names. The serializer uses capitalized names (e.g., `FunctionDeclaration`), so the deserializer should be updated to match.
- Always validate parameters for null values and throw `ArgumentNullException` when null.
- When constructing `ReturnStatement` objects in the TUI, always pass `AstLeafNode<string>` objects instead of raw strings to ensure type consistency within the AST.
- Follow code style rules and resolve warnings, including:
    - IDE0008: Use explicit type instead of 'var' where applicable.
    - CA1720: Avoid type names in identifiers (e.g., avoid "String" in `Literal.String`).
    - CA1830: Use strongly-typed StringBuilder overload.
    - CA1854: Prefer TryGetValue over ContainsKey check for dictionaries.
    - CA1834: Use StringBuilder.Append(char) for constant unit strings.
    - CA1862: Prefer string.Equals(string, StringComparison) for case-insensitive comparisons.
    - CA1062: Validate non-null parameters in externally visible methods.
    - CA1822: Mark members that do not access instance data as static.
    - CS0029: Avoid implicit type conversions that can lead to errors.
    - CS1061: Ensure objects have the DeepClone definition when calling DeepClone.
    - IDE0021: Use expression body for constructor.
- Use expression body for constructor.
- When copying `Metadata`, iterate over the dictionary using a `foreach` loop with `object?` to handle potential null values.
- When serializing to YAML, the serializer should produce camelCase names like "functionDeclaration", "parameter", "returnStatement".
- When deserializing from YAML, the deserializer must handle camelCase node names.
    - The deserializer must also correctly deserialize leaf nodes with camelCase names (e.g., `leaf<Int32>`).
    - The deserializer must handle both PascalCase and camelCase leaf nodes (e.g., `Leaf<Int32>` and `leaf<Int32>`).
- When serializing to YAML, ensure that the `defaultValue` property is correctly escaped (e.g., `defaultValue: '"default"'`).
- **YamlDeserializer.DeserializeLiteralExpression should return type `Expression?` instead of `AstNode?`.**
- **All occurrences of `ktsu.Coder.Core` have been replaced with `ktsu.Coder` in the code and documentation.**

## DEBUGGING

- Use the debugger to step through code and inspect variables.
- Write unit tests to isolate and fix bugs.
- Use logging to track the flow of execution and identify issues.
- Address code analysis warnings and errors identified during build processes (e.g., CS8852, IDE2003, CA1502, IDE0010) by refactoring code or modifying code as needed. Specifically:
    - **CS8852**: Ensure init-only properties are only assigned during object initialization, in the constructor, or in an `init` accessor.
    - **IDE2003**: Enforce blank lines between blocks and subsequent statements.
    - **CA1502**: Refactor methods with high cyclomatic complexity into smaller, more manageable methods.
    - **IDE0010**: Populate switch statements with all possible enum values or provide a default case.
- Analyze and fix compilation errors reported by the .NET build process.
- When adding rows to a table, ensure that values are not null before passing them to the `AddRow` method to avoid `CS8604` errors. Use the null-coalescing operator (`??`) to provide default values if necessary.
- Before addressing any failing tests, examine the relevant test files to understand the cause of the failures.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Submit a pull request for review before merging into the main branch.
- All pull requests must pass unit tests and code review.
- Use semantic versioning for releases.

## AST RULES

- The AST should be language-agnostic.
- AST nodes should be serializable and deserializable.
- Implement a `Clone()` method for all AST nodes to enable deep copying.
- The `Metadata` property in `AstNode` and derived classes should have a `protected init` setter to allow setting during object initialization in derived classes and prevent modification after initialization. When cloning `Metadata`, clear the existing dictionary and copy the values from the original instead of assigning a new dictionary.
- Ensure that deserialization logic respects the `protected init` setter of the `Metadata` property in `AstNode` and derived classes. Refactor deserialization logic if necessary to correctly initialize this property.
- When cloning `Metadata`, clear the existing dictionary and copy the values from the original instead of assigning a new dictionary.
- **Always construct `ReturnStatement` objects using `AstLeafNode<string>` objects instead of raw strings to maintain type consistency within the AST.**
- The project will now use a complete expression system with base `Expression` class, `BinaryExpression`, and `LiteralExpression` for a more robust and extensible AST, especially beneficial for visual editors.
- For variable assignments, the following approach should no longer be used:
```csharp
// Keep it simple but still structured
var assignment = new AssignmentStatement("result", "a + b");
var declaration = new VariableDeclaration("int", "count", "0");
```
- The project will now use a complete expression system with base `Expression` class, `BinaryExpression`, `LiteralExpression`, and `VariableReference` for a more robust and extensible AST, especially beneficial for visual editors. This system supports constructing expressions, functions, and objects via a node-based visual editor, where this library serves as the authoring and storage provider for the frontend.
- The project will now use `Literal.Text()` instead of `Literal.String()`, `Literal.Number()` instead of `Literal.Int()`, `Literal.DecimalValue()` instead of `Literal.Double()`, `Literal.SingleValue()` instead of `Literal.Float()`, and `Literal.BigNumberValue()` instead of `Literal.Long()`.
- The expression system is now complete, including:
    - `BinaryExpression` with full operator support
    - `LiteralExpression<T>` for typed literals
    - `VariableDeclaration` and `AssignmentStatement`
    - `VariableReference` for variable usage
    - Full serialization/deserialization support
    - Working code generation for Python and C#
    - Comprehensive test coverage

## DEPENDENCY INJECTION RULES

- Use `ServiceCollectionExtensions` to register language generators and serialization services.
- Always use `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(services)` at the beginning of each extension method to validate the service collection.
- All Coder services should be registered as singletons within the dependency injection container.

## PRIORITIES & RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD

1.  **Complete Expression Serialization Integration**:
    - Fix the linter error `CA1859: Change return type of method 'DeserializeLiteralExpression' from 'AstNode?' to 'Expression?'` to improve performance.
    - Ensure full serialization/deserialization support for `BinaryExpression`, `LiteralExpression`, and `VariableReference`.

2.  **High Priority Items (Visual Editor Ready):**
    - **Language Generator Enhancement:**
        - Add expression support to Python/C# generators (currently they only handle basic AST nodes).
        - Test complex expressions like `(a + b) * (c - d)` in code generation.
    - **Testing Enhancement:**
        - Add tests for new expression serialization/deserialization.
        - Add integration tests for complex expression graphs.
        - Test round-trip serialization of nested expressions.
    - **Visual Editor Foundation:**
        - Add expression builder to TUI - Allow users to create complex expressions interactively.
        - Visual expression tree display (ASCII art)
        - Expression templates - Pre-built common expressions.

3.  **Medium Priority:**
    - **Additional Language Support:**
        - JavaScript generator (framework exists, needs implementation).
        - More language templates.
    - **Advanced Features:**
        - Control flow statements (if/else, loops).
        - Function calls in expressions.
        - Array/object access expressions.

4.  **Long-term Vision (Perfect for Visual Editor):**
    - The expression system is already perfectly designed for visual programming:
        - Discrete AST nodes - Each expression is a separate object
        - Type information - ExpectedType enables connection validation
        - Deep cloning - Supports copy/paste operations
        - YAML serialization - Perfect for saving/loading visual graphs
        - Metadata support - Can store visual editor specific data (position, color, etc.)
